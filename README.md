    Work on a Mana type (maybe good idea to make Multiple types)
    Make test Items For up and down Mana type

Curse Work
    Make a Low Tier Curse (Ask for ideas)
    Tier 1: Gave and take (Suggested by Amber Dragon)
        Bad things will happen to the Cursed but then a random player will gain something from the  (MP Only)
    Tier 2: LifeBane (Suggested by Amber Dragon)

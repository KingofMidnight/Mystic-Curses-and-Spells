This is for I am able to remember what to work on and what should kinda be the way things should go

Get a Base Form
    Work on a Mana type (maybe good idea to make Multiple types)
    Make test Items For up and down Mana type

Curse Work:
    Make a Curse Menu (Key-bind: none)
    Make a Low Tier Curse (Ask for ideas)

Spell Work:
    Make a Mana Bar (Location: Bottom Right (Try Making Movable))
    Make Book Item
    Make Book Item to do Effect of a type of Spell
